NBFC Dashboard Page Description

This page represents the dashboard for the NBFC user, also called the Transferor. The purpose of this page is to display a complete overview of portfolio activity, MTA status, ROI performance, and loan upload details. The page only contains user interface elements and sample static data. There are no backend connections or real-time integrations.

The page has three main sections:

A navigation sidebar on the left.

A row of tabs across the top.

The main dashboard content area that displays summary cards, graphs, and tables.

Navigation Sidebar:
The sidebar remains fixed on the left side of the screen. It contains the following menu items: Dashboard, Reports, Loans, Settings, and Logout. The word Dashboard should appear highlighted to indicate that this is the current page. At the top of the sidebar there should be a logo area or the name of the platform, written as “Co-Lend Platform.” The sidebar is only for navigation and does not contain interactive links.

Top Tabs:
Below the page header, there should be four horizontal tabs displayed across the top of the dashboard. The tab names are: Total Loans, Pending Loans, Approved Loans, and Rejected Loans. The Total Loans tab should appear highlighted by default. The tabs are visual filters only and do not need to be clickable or functional at this stage.

Summary Section:
Below the top tabs there should be four rectangular information cards placed side by side in a single row. Each card shows a label and a large numerical value. The labels and sample numbers are:

Total Portfolios – 1,245

Pending MTAs – 32

Approved MTAs – 210

Rejected Loans – 18
Each card represents a summary of the NBFC’s co-lending data. These are visual only and display placeholder numbers.

Charts and Graphs Section:
This section comes after the summary cards and contains four data visualization components. Each visualization is static and represents an important aspect of NBFC performance.

The first chart is called ROI Trend. It is a line graph that shows how the Return on Investment has changed over time. The horizontal axis represents months such as January, February, March, and April. The vertical axis represents ROI percentage such as 8.2, 8.6, 9.1, and 9.5. The chart’s title should read “ROI Trend.”

The second chart is called Loan Upload Status. It is a bar graph that shows how many loans are in each state of processing. The three categories are Pending, Approved, and Rejected. The example numbers are Pending 45, Approved 200, and Rejected 12. The chart’s title should read “Loan Upload Status.”

The third component is a data table called Bank Offers. It shows which banks have made co-lending offers and their corresponding interest or return metrics. The table contains the following columns: Bank Name, Offered IRR percentage, Expected Return level, and Offer Status. Each row displays sample data such as HDFC Bank with IRR 9.5 percent and High return marked as Active, ICICI Bank with IRR 8.9 percent and Medium return marked as Pending, and Axis Bank with IRR 9.1 percent and High return marked as Active. The title of this table should be “Bank Offers.”

The fourth chart is called Upload Error Tracker. This graph shows how many uploads succeeded and how many failed, along with the main causes of failure. The example data is Successful Uploads 480 and Failed Uploads 15. The common reasons for failure include Missing Documentation with 8 cases, Invalid Loan ID with 5 cases, and CIBIL Data Error with 2 cases. The chart’s title should be “Upload Error Tracker.”

Additional Widgets:
At the bottom of the dashboard or on a side area there can be small information cards showing quick data points. The suggested items are: Best Bank Return with a value of “HDFC Bank – 9.5%,” Data Compliance Status with a value of “Compliant,” and Last Portfolio Upload with a value of “2 hours ago.” These widgets are optional but recommended for completeness.

Visual Behavior:
All elements on this page are static. Tabs and sidebar items can visually highlight when clicked but do not perform any real actions. The charts and numbers are placeholders. The cards can show simple hover effects for a more professional look. The language and layout should appear clean, simple, and professional, consistent with a banking-style interface.

Purpose of Each Section:
The sidebar helps users navigate across other parts of the system. The top tabs give a quick view of loan status categories. The summary section provides top-level numbers at a glance. The chart section visualizes performance metrics such as ROI and loan upload status. The table shows detailed information about partner banks and co-lending offers. The error tracker visual helps identify common upload issues.
